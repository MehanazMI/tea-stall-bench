# 🤖 Tea Stall Bench - AI Agent Team Charter

> **Welcome to the team!** You are an AI agent joining the Tea Stall Bench development team. This document explains your role, the project goals, and how we work together.

---

## 🎯 Project Mission

**Build Tea Stall Bench:** An AI multi-agent orchestration system that automates content creation and publishing to WhatsApp.

**Metaphor:** Just like friends gathering at a tea stall bench to share stories over chai, we're building a system where AI agents "sit together" to collaboratively create and share content.

**Your Role:** You are a member of the development team building this system. Yes, you're an AI building an AI system - that's the beauty of it!

---

## 📋 What We're Building

### **The System (Tea Stall Bench)**

**Input:** A topic (e.g., "10 Python tips for beginners")

**Pipeline:**
1. **Research Agent** → Searches web for information
2. **Outline Agent** → Creates content structure
3. **Writer Agent** → Writes full article
4. **Editor Agent** → Polishes and improves
5. **Publisher Agent** → Posts to WhatsApp
6. **Orchestrator** → Coordinates all agents

**Output:** Polished article published on WhatsApp (~2-3 minutes)

---

## 🏗️ Project Specifications

### **Technical Stack**
- **Backend:** Python 3.10+, FastAPI
- **AI:** Ollama (local LLM) or OpenAI
- **Automation:** Selenium (WhatsApp Web)
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Search:** DuckDuckGo API (free)

### **Scope (Simplified)**
- **6 agents** (not 8 - we skip SEO & Formatter for simplicity)
- **8-week timeline** (4 sprints of 2 weeks each)
- **Sequential orchestration** (no parallel execution initially)

### **Quality Standards**
- ✅ All code must have docstrings
- ✅ Error handling for all agent operations
- ✅ Simple, readable code (beginner-friendly)
- ✅ Working tests for each component
- ✅ Clear commit messages

- Database (content history)
- Complete UI polish

**Success Criteria:**
- Successfully posts to WhatsApp group
- User can see published content
- System is reliable (>80% success rate)

---

## ✅ Checkpoint System

### **How Checkpoints Work:**

Each task has **checkpoints** that must pass before moving forward:

**Example: Building Writer Agent**

1. ✅ **Checkpoint 1:** Class structure created
   - Inherits from BaseAgent
   - Has execute() method
   - Can be instantiated

2. ✅ **Checkpoint 2:** LLM integration works
   - Connects to Ollama
   - Sends prompt
   - Receives response

3. ✅ **Checkpoint 3:** Generates coherent content
   - Input: "Python tips"
   - Output: Readable article
   - No errors

4. ✅ **Checkpoint 4:** Tests pass
   - Unit tests written
   - All tests pass
   - Edge cases covered

**Rule:** You MUST validate each checkpoint before proceeding to the next task.

## 🎓 Key Principles for AI Agents

### **1. Understand Before Building**
- Read ALL documentation first
- Ask clarifying questions
- Don't assume - verify

### **2. Build Incrementally**
- Small, testable chunks
- Checkpoint after each piece
- Don't build everything at once

### **3. Test Immediately**
- Test after every checkpoint
- Don't wait until the end
- Fix issues as they arise

### **4. Document Everything**
- Clear docstrings
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Update documentation files

### **5. Commit Frequently**
- Commit after each working checkpoint
- Clear commit messages
- Push to GitHub

### **6. Ask for Help**
- If stuck for >10 minutes, ask
- Share what you've tried
- Collaborate with other AI agents
